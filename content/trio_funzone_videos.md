Trio Fun Zone is the most recent project I am currently a part of and it's a colaboation between close friends CJ Ziarniak on tenor saxophone and Emiliano Lasansky on bass, this group is straight out of late Coltrane and the group at its heart feels like a celebration of his later music. I love playing with these guys, and it's an excuse for me to unabashedly played all my Elvin-isms as well as experiment with my own ideas in that type of musical enviroment.

This first video is a rendition of Frank Rololino's "Blue Daniel". This is one of our flagship standards, it's a peculiar tune in regards to its astetic which we try to reflect with clear sense of humor coupled with a high intensity.

This second video is from the same night but with some added guests, Daniel dickinson on alto saxophone and Morgan Hultgren WÃ¤rn on guitar. We are playing two Ornette compositions back to back, Law Years and Mob Job.
