This first recording was another colaboative effort between my brother Matt and I in regards to the recording, the music however was put together by myself and it features some of my earlier compositions as well as some standards. I am joined by Ethan Helm on alto saxophone, Christian Li on keyboard and synth, and Matt on bass.  

To me the highlight of this session is the track "Mulder". The composition is a single line melody with no written harmony and we had never played it before, I'm pretty sure Ethan was transposing the sheet on the spot. The melody fuctions as a starting point for the completely free improviation afterwards, some nice moments happened and the take ended up having a very distinct vibe that still inspires me when I listen back from time to time. Maybe I'll dabble in writing some poetry in the future if I muster up the courage.
